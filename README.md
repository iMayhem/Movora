# ⚙️ How It Works

* All **movie/TV data & images** are fetched from **TMDB API**.
* The app **does not store or host any videos**.
* When you tap **Play**, the app:

  1. Builds a link to an external video site.
  2. Opens that link in a built-in **WebView**.
  3. Video is streamed directly from the external site’s servers.
* Without internet, the app **won’t work** (no offline mode).

Enjoy Streaming
