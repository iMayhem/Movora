# Movora Website to Flutter App Conversion - Setup Guide

## Overview

This guide will help you convert your Movora Next.js website into a fully functional Flutter mobile app. The app will maintain the same functionality and design aesthetic while providing a native mobile experience.

## What Has Been Created

I've already created the complete Flutter project structure with:

âœ… **Core Files Created:**
- `pubspec.yaml` - Flutter dependencies and configuration
- `lib/main.dart` - App entry point
- `lib/theme/app_theme.dart` - Dark/light theme configuration
- `lib/models/media.dart` - Movie/TV show data model
- `lib/services/tmdb_service.dart` - TMDB API integration
- `lib/providers/movie_provider.dart` - State management
- `lib/widgets/movie_card.dart` - Individual movie display
- `lib/widgets/movie_list.dart` - Horizontal movie lists
- `lib/screens/home_screen.dart` - Main home screen
- `lib/config/app_config.dart` - App configuration
- `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` - Android permissions
- `test/widget_test.dart` - Basic testing
- `setup_flutter.bat` - Windows setup script
- `README.md` - Project documentation

âœ… **Directory Structure:**
- `lib/` - Main app code
- `assets/` - Images, icons, and fonts
- `android/` - Android-specific configuration
- `test/` - Testing files

## Next Steps to Complete the Setup

### 1. Install Flutter SDK

**Windows:**
1. Download Flutter SDK from: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/windows
2. Extract to `C:\flutter` (or your preferred location)
3. Add `C:\flutter\bin` to your PATH environment variable
4. Restart your terminal/command prompt

**Verify Installation:**
```bash
flutter doctor
```

### 2. Get TMDB API Key

1. Visit [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
2. Create an account and sign in
3. Go to Settings â†’ API â†’ Request API Key
4. Choose "Developer" option
5. Fill out the form and submit
6. Copy your API key

### 3. Update API Key

Replace `YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY` in these files:
- `lib/services/tmdb_service.dart` (line 7)
- `lib/config/app_config.dart` (line 18)

### 4. Install Dependencies

Run this command in your project directory:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 5. Add Fonts (Optional)

For the best experience, download and add these fonts to `assets/fonts/`:
- Inter (Regular, Medium, SemiBold, Bold)
- Space Grotesk (Regular, Medium, SemiBold, Bold)

Or update `pubspec.yaml` to use system fonts by removing the font section.

### 6. Run the App

**Android:**
```bash
flutter run
```

**iOS (macOS only):**
```bash
flutter run -d ios
```
